# LQGDrone
This repository is based on Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) based stabilization-control and estimation for a single-plane drone model along a desired Non-linear trajectory. The code presented here is based on fixed-time horizon LQG, and it is important to note that there are some issues with it -- most notable ones could be in the perturbation dynamics where I considered ground collision for some weird reason lol (most of it was implemented in a hurry and I was new to MATLAB back when I first coded this up). It might serve as starting point for new control theory enthusiasts ("Energy of the system" based and very intuitive to learn). There is also the final write-up which is in the IEEE-Conference format. This would be a nice starting point to understand the code. Thank you! :)
