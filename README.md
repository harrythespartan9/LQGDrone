# LQGDrone
This repository is based on Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) based stabilization-control and estimation for a single-plane drone model along a desired Non-linear trajectory. The code presented here is based on fixed-time horizon LQG. It might serve as starting point for new control theory enthusiasts ("Energy of the system" based and very intuitive to learn). There is also the final write-up which is in the IEEE-Conference format. This would be a nice starting point to understand the code. Thank you! :)
